Most people would think growing up in a bilingual house would make you an expert on both those languages, but in my case, it didn't turn out well. Growing up in a bilingual house wasn't the only reason why I had a lot of issues with my use of language. My family didn't really fit in the environment we lived in. Trying to fit in an unfamiliar environment wasn't exactly an easy task for me. While trying to fit into that environment, I had to change a lot about the way I use language. Especially moving to the U.S. affected the way I use language drastically. I had another personality under my English skills since I had to speak and write depending on where I am. In my opinion, the reason why I lack some language skills all started while growing up in a bilingual house. My father was born and raised in the U.S. while my mother was born and raised in Turkey. Turkish was the main language that was spoken in our home. My father's Turkish wasn't the best and it was obvious that Turkish wasn't his first language even though he had been learning Turkish his whole life. My father's parents are actually Turkish, and he grew up in a bilingual house as well. Trying to speak Turkish as a kid didn't really improve his ability to speak Turkish by a lot. Even though my mother was an expert in using the Turkish language, constantly hearing my father speaking Turkish with his accent and poor choice of words ever since I was a baby, gave me a weird Turkish accent and poor judgement on my choice of words. So ever since I was a little kid, my Turkish language skills weren't exactly like a native speaker and I only knew a couple of English words. Growing in this kind of environment prevented me from developing a stable way of speaking or writing. By this I mean I didn't have a strong background of the use of language so I tend to get affected a lot by an environment or a person. </p>				<h3>Research Essay</h3>				<p>Throughout my life, I have never been able to use language to express myself clearly.
