This is my first semester here at the University at Buffalo. I am majoring in Computer Science. I was born in Izmir, Turkey, but I have been living in the United States for the last three years.</p> 				<h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>				<p>I was accepted to the University at Buffalo as an Aerospace Engineering major, but after a little thinking I decided to start my college career as a Computer Science major. There are two main reason behind my decision. The first reason is my interest in the subject. My father is a software engineer and ever since I was a little kid, seeing the work he has done has always interested me. I would love to be doing what he has been doing for his whole life. The second reason is the amount of job opportunities. Computers are our future, and I would like to be a part of the development of our future. </p>				<h3>Hobbies</h3>				<p>Playing basketball</p>				<p>Listening to music</p>				<p>Playing the guitar</p>				<p>Sleeping</p>				<p>Playing videogames</p>				<h3>Contact Information</h3>				<p>E-mail: </p><a href="mailto:alanalpe@buffalo.edu" target="_top"  target="_blank">alanalpe@buffalo.edu</a><p></p><a href="mailto:alkin.alper@gmail.com" target="_top" target="_blank">alkin.alper@gmail.com</a><p></p>				<p>YouTube Channel: </p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwxO00EXCxXvFO__kzBhrAQ" target="_blank">Alan Alkin Alper</a>				</div>		</div>		<div id = "footer">			<div class = "container">Â©Copyright Notice - Site maintained by Alan A.
